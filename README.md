# Ilia - A Desktop Executor

Ilia is a tool for users to invoke actions such as launching apps, viewing notifications, and finding windows.
It provides a modal interface consisting of a filter box, and a list of matching items.
There are a set pages that can be selected from by specifying the desired page via a command-line parameter or by tab if all pages are loaded (controlled by command-line parameter).

## Features

Ilia provides pages to view and select from the following types of things:

- Desktop Apps (`apps`)
- System Commands (`terminal`)
- Desktop Keybindings (`keybindings`)
- Notifications (`notifications`)
- Text List (`textlist`)
- File Search (`tracker`)
- Open Windows (`windows`)

## Usage

Ilia can be launched from a terminal. The `-p` option allows to specify which page to present to the user.

Ex:

```
ilia -p keybindings
```

### Desktop Apps

Ilia searches the system-configured `$XDG_DATA_DIRS` with `applications` applied at the end of each path for desktop application files.
For example, if your system has `$HOME/.local/share` in the set of paths in `$XDG_DATA_DIRS`, the path `$HOME/.local/share/applications/` will be searched for desktop app files.

### Text List

The `textlist` page is a bit different than the others pages.
It provides a general purpose utility to provide a list of options for the user select and when the selection occurs, the selected item is returned by the invocation to `ilia`.
In this way the program can be used in scripts to get user input from dynamic data, similar to `rofi`.
The `textlist` page supports two additional parameters for more customization:

```
'textlist' - select an item from a specified list
        -l: page label
        -i: page icon
```

## Configuration

Ilia supports the following configuration via gsettings under the namespace `org.regolith-linux.ilia`:

- window-width: width of window in pixels
- window-height: height of window in pixels
- icon-size: size of icons in pixels or 0 to disable icons

### Example: Resetting screen width

```
gsettings reset org.regolith-linux.ilia window-width
```

## Dependencies

### Notifications

This page communicates with the [Rofication](https://github.com/regolith-linux/regolith-rofication) daemon for managing desktop notifications.

### Keybindings

This page uses the comment format specified by [Remontoire](https://github.com/regolith-linux/remontoire) and reads the i3 config via it's local socket.

## Build

Ilia uses `meson` and `ninja` to build:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/regolith-linux/ilia.git
mkdir ilia/build
cd ilia/build
meson ..
ninja
src/ilia
```

By default, Ilia builds with release optimizations. For debug builds:

```shell
meson setup builddebug --buildtype=debug
ninja -C builddebug
```

## Lint

### Uncrustify

```shell
ninja fixstyle
```

## Package

Debian packages for Debian and Ubuntu are available in the [Regolith package repository](https://github.com/regolith-linux/voulage).
